<center>Admonition

**$\quad$** The book you are about to read is a set of conferences presented to the *Semaine Catholique* in February, 1926, by Rev. Fr. A. Roussel (Doctor of Philosophy, Professor of the Major Seminary of Rennes, France). These and other similar conferences were given under the auspices of the Apostolic League for the Return of Nations to the Christian Order.
These have now been translated from the original French and adapted to the English reader by Rev. Fr. Coenraad Daniels, priest of The Society of Saint Pius X.
