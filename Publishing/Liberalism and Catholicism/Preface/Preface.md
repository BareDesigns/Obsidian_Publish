**$\quad$** Archbishop Lefebvre called it the *"great betrayal"[^1]*.
He was speaking of Catholic liberalism, the attempt to reconcile the Church with the revolution.
He explains himself:

> ... there is in liberal Catholicism (a term that I use with repugnance, because it is a blasphemy) a betrayal of the principles which it disavows, a practical apostasy of the Faith in the social kingship of Our Lord Jesus Christ.[^2]

**$\quad$** It is the development of liberalism and its progressive infiltration into the Catholic Church which Fr. Rousell's book traces for us.
This phenomenon, which began with the French Revolution of 1789 and progressed throughout the 19th century, engendering modernism at the beginning of the 20th century, is of the utmost importance for us at the end of the 20th century.
It has now brought forth its bitter fruits, the destruction of the whole order of society, as Pope Gregory XVI predicted in 1832:

> Thence, in fact, the instability of minds; thence the ever increasing corruption of the young;
> thence, in the people, the contempt of sacred rights and holiest laws and things;
> thence, in a word, the saddest scourge that can ravage States, since experience attests, and the remotest antiquity teaches,
> that cities powerful in wealth, dominion, and glory perished by this sole evil -- the unbridled liberty of opinions,
> the license of public discourse, the passion for changes.[^3]

**$\quad$** This is precisely what we are witnessing at the end of this 20th century.
The church having been engulfed by liberalism, society is now falling apart. 

**$\quad$** We are very grateful, indeed, for Fr. Daniel's making this text available to us in English.
For it is impossible to comprehend the crisis in the post-conciliar church, and the radical transformation attempted in the name of progress since Vatican II, without understanding the liberal mindset which prepared the way.
This book is consequently indispensable for any student of the history of the crisis in the Church or of Vatican II.
It is likewise crucial for us to read and absorb if we are to know how to react to post-conciliar liberalism, that is if we are to have the strength of conviction to refuse all compromise with the attack on the supernatural Catholic Faith that it really is.

**$\quad$** The importance of this book can be measured by these words of Archbishop Lefebvre:

> Yes, truly, Vatican Council II is the ratification of liberal Catholicism. 
> And when it is remembered that Pope Pius IX, 85 years earlier, said and repeated to those who were visiting him in Rome;
> "Be careful! There are no worse enemies of the Church that the liberal Catholics!" - then can be measured the catastrophe that such liberal Popes and such a council represent for the Church and for the reign of Our Lord Jesus Christ![^4]
