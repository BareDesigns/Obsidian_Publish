## Why prove God?

Why should one even attempt to prove that God exists?

+ To better understand the faith
+ To defend the faith
+ To grow our knowledge through the use of reason
---

## Errors

Without coming from a place of reason, we might fall into circular reasoning

## Understanding

To understand something, it's important to know what something is, and what it **ISN'T**

+ The arguments are not defenses of any denomination 

---


## Overview

Because the arguments are lengthy, we will break them down 1 argument at a time. 

+ Note taking is encouraged, but listening and thinking is more important in these contexts
+ Ask lots of questions!
