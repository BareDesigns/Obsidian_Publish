**Instructor:** Jon  
**Email:** Jon.Nguyen7@Protonmail.com

## Tips

Make good use of questions. The material and language used in the course are not common in today's vernacular, so please ask questions.

## Course Goals

**$\quad$** The goal of this course will be to introduce the students to the arguments and terminology presented by classical philosophers and theologians.

**$\quad$** The primary subject will be St. Thomas Aquinas, and the '5 ways' he presents in his work the 'Summa Theologia'.

**$\quad$** In addition to providing a **broad overview** of the subject matter, students will be presented with counter-arguments against them. This will allow for a more broad-scope approach to the learning material.

**$\quad$** By the end of the series, the students should have at least a simple understanding of the unique terms and ideas presented in Classical Theism. Even if not fully comprehended, the introduction of terms will build a foundation for complete knowledge in the future.

## Timeline

**$\quad$** The estimated timeline is 5-7 weeks, with one session a week.

**$\quad$** Each week will include a presentation on one specific 'way', broken down into it's most fundamental aspects and arguments. No additional readings will be required, but should you find it necessary I can make an overview document with definitions and concepts the student can review.

Below is planned timeline:

*  **Week One:** Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle
*  **Week Two:** The First Way
*  **Week Three:** The Second Way
*  **Week Four:** The Third Way
*  **Week Five:** The Fourth Way
*  **Week Six:** The Fifth Way
*  **Week Seven:** Recap and overview

## How to take good notes

Definitions will be provided, so no need to write them down. The key to taking good notes in this series will be to only write down a minimal amount.

When dealing with abstract concepts, listening is more important than writing. But, if one needs to write something down, it should be as brief and short as possible so as not to derail the thought process or miss out on key concepts myself or a classmate has brought forth.

## Grading

The grading scale is as follows:

* PASS
* NOT PASS

The easiest way to pass is not be be a renowned theologian by the end, but simply asking questions and staying engaged.
