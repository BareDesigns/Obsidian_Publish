# Divine Atonement Thoughts

> These are quick *off the cuff* notes. I'll add references and refinements when I can sit down and devote more time to it.

## Intro

What is divine atonement theory? Simply that we needed atonement for our sins.

#### Modern View

What is the *modern* view? 

Sometimes called *"Ransom Theory"*, it is a certain belief about the passion of Christ that summarily describes is as a ransom paid to God by God to appease God's Justice. (Sloppy Summary I know).

#### Issues

The problem with this theory is that it put unnecessary constraints on God, as if he couldn't simply forgive sins without a blood sacrifice. 
Also, given the ransom - prisoner nature, this would conclude that the price was paid to Satan.[^1]

#### Alternative

One alternative, or chiefly the Traditional view on the passion, is simply a bridge of Grace to reunify the temporal with the eternal.

What does this mean? When man sinned, he removed himself from God, which means that he was no longer in connection with the eternal. 
Man, being mortal, cannot alone traverse the infinite due to his finite nature. So, he was left a slave to death, and forever separated from God.

#### The Passion

Enter the passion. Jesus, being the logos of God, being man. Therefore he was fully man, and fully God. Ultimately through this nature and by his passion, he was able to "bridge" the infinite chasm and reunite man with God through sanctifying grace.

On the resurrection, Christ defeated death, and left us a passage to him in the now, mainly by grace through the Sacraments (Baptism, Holy Communion etc)

#### Conclusion

Long story short, without fully understanding the nature of God or the chasm of sin and merely reducing the Passion to an atonement to an angry God, we miss out on the metaphysical beauty of Tradition and the love that God has for man.

If it was only a "blood sacrifice", God is only wrath and justice. But if is more than that, God also is more.
