Tags: [[Sacraments]]

## Notes

*Sources of Catholic Dogma:*
Some protestants might argue that infant baptism is given without the consent of the child, therefore is invalid. This does not follow. Just as original sin was given without express permission of the person, so can it be removed by the faith of the parent through baptism.

- *Pope Innocent III: "Gaudemus in Domino" (1201)*

The time for the child to choose the Catholic Faith willingly is during [[Confirmation]].
